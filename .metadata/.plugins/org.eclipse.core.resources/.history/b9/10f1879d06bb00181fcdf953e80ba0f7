/*541. Reverse String II

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters 
counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. 
If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first
k characters and left the other as original.

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"*/
